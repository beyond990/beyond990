Hi, Iâ€™m @beyond990 an IT Infrastructure engineer in Birmingham UK. I have a strong background in Network and SAN storage having worked with NetApp as a partner and customer for around 12 years.

From a programming aspect Iâ€™m interested in:
- Python 
  - Django
  - Flask
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Rest API interaction
- Java SE 
- JakartaEE

Iâ€™m currently learning and working on integration between ServiceNow and Nagios Core monitoring, using Rest API calls, using experience gained writing RestAPI calls on NetApp storage to monitor the storage environment.

An interesting side note, my username beyond990 comes from the last 3 number of my military ID and the fact this is now me **beyond** the Army ðŸ™‚ i liked it then and it has stuck with me ever since.
