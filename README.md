Hi, I’m @beyond990 an IT Infrastructure engineer in Birmingham UK. I have a strong background in Network and SAN storage having worked with NetApp 
as a partner and customer.

From a programming aspect I’m interested in:
- Python 
  - Django
  - Flask
  - SQLAlchemy
  - Rest API interaction
- Java SE 
- JakartaEE

I’m currently learning and working on integration between ServiceNow and Nagios Core monitoring, using Rest API calls, using experience gained writing RestAPI 
calls on NetApp storage to monitor the storage environment.
